# Exploratory Study on Suicidal Rate Analysis (1986-2016)

**Project Description:**
This project delves into these factors using a dataset of 44,000 samples from 141 countries spanning the 1980s to 2016. We aim to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict suicide rates in various demographics.

**Overview:**
- Data sourced from Kaggle: [Suicide Rates Overview (1985 to 2016)](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016)
- Steps:
  1. Data Wrangling
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis
  3. Machine Learning + Predictive Analytics
  4. Conclusions
- Findings presented in a report on Google Sites: [Suicide Rate Analysis](https://sites.google.com/view/suicide-rate-analysis)

**Questions for Analysis:**
- Which years have the most and least suicide cases?
- Which countries have the highest and lowest suicide cases?
- Is there a correlation between age groups and suicide cases?
- What is the relationship between gender and suicide cases?

**Results:**
- Population Pyramid
- Age vs. Suicide Count
- Country vs. Suicide Count
- Suicide vs. Sex
- GDP vs. Suicide

**Conclusions:**
- Decrease in suicides in the '80s followed by a rise.
- Russian alcohol consumption linked to high suicide rates, but data limited due to Soviet secrecy.
- Middle-aged adults (30-60) show the highest suicide rates.
- Gender disparity in suicide rates, with males more prone.
- Mental health a significant predictor of suicide.
